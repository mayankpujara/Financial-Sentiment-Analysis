# Financial Sentiment Analysis

This repository contains code for sentiment analysis on financial text data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning. The project aims to predict sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) from financial-related sentences.

## Prerequisites

Before using this code, you should have the following installed:

- Python (>=3.7)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, but recommended)
- Required libraries can be installed via pip:
  ```sh
  pip install pandas numpy nltk scikit-learn matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/mayankpujara/Financial-Sentiment-Analysis.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd Financial-Sentiment-Analysis

## Dataset

The code uses a dataset from 'data.csv' containing the Finance-sentences and sentiment labels (e.g., 'negative,' 'neutral,' 'positive'). The dataset may require additional preprocessing and cleaning, as demonstrated in the code.
